Child Protection Policy for MiAmor Chat and Date
Effective Date: May 12, 2025

MiAmor Chat and Date ("MiAmor", "we", "our", "the App") is committed to ensuring the safety and privacy of all individuals, particularly children. Our app is designed exclusively for adults aged 18 and older and explicitly prohibits the use of the platform by anyone under the age of 18.

This Child Protection Policy outlines the measures we take to comply with child safety standards, including the Google Play Child Safety and Families Policy, and to ensure that no minor is exposed to inappropriate content or interactions through our app.

1. Age Restriction Policy
MiAmor is strictly intended for users 18 years and older.

During registration, users are required to provide their date of birth, and the system automatically blocks registration if the user is underage.

Age misrepresentation is considered a serious violation, and we take proactive measures to detect and prevent it.

2. Prevention Measures
To enforce this restriction, we implement the following:

2.1. Age Verification
Users must provide their full date of birth during signup.

The app‚Äôs backend system flags and blocks accounts where the age is under 18.

2.2. Profile Monitoring
AI-based moderation tools monitor uploaded images and profile data for signs of underage users.

Suspicious accounts are automatically flagged for review by our moderation team.

2.3. Reporting Tools
Users can report profiles they suspect are underage or fraudulent via in-app tools.

Reports are reviewed promptly, and confirmed underage accounts are immediately suspended and deleted.

3. No Targeting of Children
The app does not contain any content designed for or appealing to children.

The app is not listed in the Google Play "Designed for Families" program.

Ads and marketing do not target children in any way.

4. Compliance with Google Play Policies
We strictly adhere to the following policies:

Google Play Developer Policy: MiAmor declares that it is not directed toward children and restricts access to those 18+.

Families Policy Requirements: MiAmor does not include any content inappropriate for children nor collect data from children.

The app‚Äôs store listing clearly states:

"This app is intended for adults 18+ only. No minors are permitted."

5. Data Handling & Privacy
MiAmor does not knowingly collect or store any data from users under 18.

If we discover that we have inadvertently collected data from a minor, we delete it immediately.

All data is managed under our Privacy Policy, which complies with applicable data protection laws, including GDPR and COPPA where relevant.

6. Enforcement and Review
Our moderators are trained to recognize indicators of underage users or abuse.

We conduct periodic reviews of flagged accounts and reported incidents.

Users found violating this policy will have their accounts suspended or permanently removed.
